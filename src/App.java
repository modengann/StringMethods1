/*** Instructions:
 *   Complete the method twoLetters based on the requirements listed below
 * 
 *   The method twoLetters will accept two variables as parameters: a String and an int called index. The method header has been completed already
 *   Based on these parameters the method will return a String that is two characters long starting from the given index.
 * 
 *   For example:
 *   twoLetters("java", 0) will return "ja" because the given index was 0, so it returns the first two letters of the given word
 *   
 *   For example:
 *   twoLetters("java", 2) will return "va" because in this case we are starting at index location 2 (letter 'v') and 
 *   returning a String made out of that and the next letter
 * 
 *   For example:
 *   twoLetters("java", 3) will return "ja" because unlike in other cases, when we start at index 3 we will be at the end of the provided String.
 *   So we don't have remaining letters to return a String with length 2. Therefore, based on the rules listed above we return the first two letters "ja".
 *  
 *   *   A+ bonus challenge: 
*   Add additional features to the code to demonstrate mastery. Be creative! Show off what you know!
